# 2019 ECNU Mathematics Lottery
A simple lottery program used in the party of School of Mathematical Science, East China Normal University. The supporting namelist file (unuploaded) should be in the path ./素材/名册.csv.
I haven't uploaded the namelist because of the privacy concern. 

This program is based on **easyGUI** and generated by **pyinstaller** and in **Windows 10** OS. **I won't maintain this program** due to my graduation. If there is anyone want to use it, feel free to clone and if there is any question, please contact me by email.

## Easy Tutorial
If you want to generate a new exe file, print the following command in the command line under your file path.
```
pyintaller -F lottery.py
```

If you want to remove the **console** in the exe, add "--noconsole" after your command.
```
pyintaller -F lottery.py --noconsole
```
